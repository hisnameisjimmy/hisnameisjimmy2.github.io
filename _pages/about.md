This is just a place for me to write about things I've thought a lot about. I make no claims, I am not an academic, and it's pretty likely I don't know what I'm talking about or have significant gaps in my understanding of the problem.

### More Information

Currently Senior PM at [Nylas, Inc](https://www.nylas.com) - A VC backed startup killing it in the API space for email/contacts/calendars.

Previously VP of Product at [Badger Maps, Inc.](https://www.badgermapping.com). A bootstrapped startup I helped take from 4 employees and no product to over $4mm in ARR and 70 employees across multiple countries. Even got to live in Spain for 1.5 years as part of the experience!

### Side Projects
[Art Diario](https://www.artdiario.com) - New, beautifully curated art on your desktop every day. 

I love making practical, easy-to-use products that are a pleasure to use over and over again.
