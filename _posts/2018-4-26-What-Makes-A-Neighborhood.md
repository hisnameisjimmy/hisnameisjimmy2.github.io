title: What makes a neighborhood
---

In my opinion, one of the cornerstones of what makes a great neighborhood is what kind of stores are able to afford renting a space on the ground floor of a building. The cheaper the better, as this leads to an incredible menagerie of shops that are just not possible on the upper-end.

If I can setup a workship that allows people to learn how to knit, I'm probably not rolling in money. But I am adding incredible character to my block. People get to know eachother, become friends, share a drink, and learn a new skill. I'm building community.

The biggest problem with the new construction going up in San Fransisco isn't just the fact that they are all geared towards people with obscene paychecks [^nouveauriche], but that they suck character out of neighborhoods by denying small shops. The only places that can afford these glass walled ground floors are larger companies, or companies that sell products that are extremely highly priced.

It's fine when neighborhoods in cities are capable of serving the tastes of the rich. Why shouldn't they? But when there's no room for other shops that serve the other 99%, you get a strange homogenization towards an extreme minority of people. Further, because almost all this construction is built with purely glass walls, the storefronts all feel very similar visually. I understand that being able to see inside a store often draws people in, but the lack of differentiation here seems like an enormous loss to the visual delight that is most cities.

Like many, I want to see complex neighborhoods develop that can cater not only to the nouveau riche, but to all classes, races, and cultures. The intermingling of different classes, industry, and interests is what makes cities exciting cultural touchstones.

As a developer, taking on construction in San Francisco is daunting. The regulatory hurdles are immense, the number of community meetings is brutal, and while everyone wants to get the rent prices down, they don't want new buildings to hurt their neighboardhood's existing character. [^nimby]

However, I think as a developer in a city as culturally rich as San Francisco, you have a responsibility to add to that culture. While we may not need to demand below market rent for new tenants like we do for new apartments, we should at least be demanding spaces that can allow the 'hole in the wall' places to exist.

Cities thrive on variety. We need variety.

[^nouveauriche]: This is not always true, but more units in general is a good thing and in time will push down prices.
