Currently VP of Product at [Badger Maps, Inc.](https://www.badgermapping.com)

This is just a place for me to write about things I've thought a lot about. I make no claims, I am not an academic, and it's pretty likely I don't know what I'm talking about or have significant gaps in my understanding of the problem.

### More Information
