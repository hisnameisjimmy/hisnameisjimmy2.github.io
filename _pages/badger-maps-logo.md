After having been at Badger for a few years, a number of things bothered me about the logo. It was originally purchased from a website similar to 99 Designs to get the job done. While conceptually very cool (combo of a Badger and map pin) and having some good bones, the logo was hastily completed and it showed. I wanted to massage the logo to get it to the point where it felt more strongly designed. 

A few goals I had:

- Make the logo look like it flowed. The curves of the current logo lacked harmony and didn't have a sense that they knew where they were going.
- Make it bolder. I wanted to be able to flip the logo to a black and white form (sans the red interior) and for it to still feel strong. With the original, the thin lines made the logo look strange and incomplete in black and white.
- Make the logo more consistent and balanced. The structure and lines of the original looked almost lopsided and had abruptly ending structures in it. The lines themselves were also not consistent widths without any reasoning to them.

The resulting logo, to me at least, is a massive difference. It reduces FAR better. it feels more confident, it flows. it feels like it knows what it's doing.
