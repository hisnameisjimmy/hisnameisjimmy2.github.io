This is just a place for me to write about things I've thought a lot about. I make no claims, I am not an academic, and it's pretty likely I don't know what I'm talking about or have significant gaps in my understanding of the problem.

### More Information

Currently VP of Product at [Badger Maps, Inc.](https://www.badgermapping.com)

I helped take the company from four employees and zero customers to millions in ARR, thousands of trial signups a month, and over 45 employees across four countries completely bootstrapped. 

As the lead designer, I designed and oversaw development of our applications across the Web, iOS (a universal app), and Android. I'm also a seasoned front-end developer who can both design and implement those designs in HTML/CSS/JS.

As VP of Product, I've driven our roadmap, structured and implemented a sane, event-driven analytics strategy, our deployment workflows, branding, revenue experiements, the support team, our SEO strategy, and more. 

I love making practical, easy-to-use products that are a pleasure to use over and over again.
